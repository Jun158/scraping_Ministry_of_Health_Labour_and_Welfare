# scraping_Ministry_of_Health_Labour_and_Welfare
*This repo is for my online resume.*

This program scraps information on worker dispatching and job placement businesses in the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's databank. The point we took care of was to determine a save point. This program, which processes in real-time, does not know when and under what circumstances it will stop. For this reason, we incorporated a program that outputs the processed data at regular intervals. Also, when the program starts, it specifies which business page and for how long it wants the information, so we built in that mechanism.
